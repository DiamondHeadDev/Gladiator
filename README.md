# Gladiator

Project Gladiator is a 2D Roguelike Strategy RPG with a branching narrative, designed for PC Platforms.

Project Gladiator is set in the distant future where androids are forced to fight for their human creators in a gladiatorial ring.
Players must make a series of strategic and narrative decisions in order to ensure their survival, and the survival of the characters they grow to care about.

The game consists of three phases.

1. All gladiators spend their evenings in the Quantic Vision Bar, where they can meet with human sponsors to get access to better equipment.
This is also a great place for the androids to meet each other and build relationships, which the player is encouraged to do.
A strong relationship between gladiators may lead to new opportunities, but if you draw too much attention to yourselves, there's a chance human authorities will pit you against each other.

2. The following morning, enemy combatants will be announced, and the player will have an opportunity to purchase inventory items to get ready for the upcoming battle using currency they've earned in battle and from sponsors.
Given that the player is an Android, they have the opportunity to swap out a significant number of parts, and add pieces of equipment to different parts of their body.
These equipments and upgrades will be retained across stages of combat, giving the player a sense of progression after each subsequent battle.

3. After selecting all upgrades, combat wil begin.  The player is presented with a screen that shows the status of all parts of the android, and what equipment they have on each piece,
in addition to a visualization of the enemy with options for "Attack", "Defend", "Talk", and "Item".  Combat is turn based and players have the opportunity to target individual parts
of the enemy android.  Additionally, players can talk their way out of combat if they have built up enough of a relationship with the enemy combatant.  Failing to take down another combatant
will result in no monetary reward, but has the opportunity to provide benefits of other kinds to the player (i.e. maybe the enemy combatant has a good relationship with a sponsors and can
get you access to a better deal on parts).

Through the course of numerous narrative decisions, players will move through a decision tree, leading to different opponents.  The elements that comprise this decision tree can be moved around and modified
to allow for a new player experience each time you play.  Players will also encounter different parts on subsequent playthroughs that allow for a different playing experience.
